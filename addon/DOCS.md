## About

All-in-One EnOcean to MQTT bridge with a modern web UI for Home Assistant.
This add-on replaces the need for separate EnOcean bridges and YAML configuration.
Add your EnOcean devices visually, browse EEP profiles, and manage MQTT mappings —
all from within Home Assistant.

### Key Features

- **Visual Device Wizard** — Add, edit and remove EnOcean devices through a web UI
- **Teach-In Mode** — Automatic device detection when pressing the learn button
- **96+ EEP Profiles** — Built-in EnOcean Equipment Profile browser

## Quick Start

1. **Configure** your EnOcean USB serial port in the add-on settings
2. **Start** the add-on and open the Web UI via the sidebar
3. **Add a device**: Click "Add Device", choose Teach-In, and press the learn button on your EnOcean device
4. **Done** — The device appears automatically in Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery

## Web UI

![Devices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7981a0-9db0-4e63-9bd1-2bd4d20c5c85)

### Dashboard
Overview with connection status, device counts, recent telegrams and unknown device detection.

### Devices
List and manage all configured EnOcean devices. Add, edit, or remove devices.

### EEP Profiles
Browse the complete EnOcean Equipment Profile tree with dedicated sections for
Custom Profiles, Customized Mappings, and the standard EEP tree. Search across
all profiles and view field definitions.

![EEP Profiles](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa4d4142-b873-4862-823e-815bec9fc7ac)

### Entity Mappings
Define how EEP profile fields map to Home Assistant entities (sensor, binary_sensor,
switch, light, cover, etc.). Each EEP profile detail view includes a "Customize" button
to override the default mapping — with auto-fill from EEP.xml field definitions and
per-profile save/reset. Advanced fields like `state_class`, `entity_category`,
`expire_after`, `force_update`, and `value_template` are supported.

Toggle between Visual and Text (YAML) editing modes for full control:

![Text Mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6b188da-a61e-4ec1-aae3-c01bb805b45e)

### Custom & Forked Profiles
Create fully custom EEP profiles for non-standard devices, or "fork" a standard
profile to customize its Telegram Fields and HA mappings together.

![Custom Profile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da98b5c-14cf-4e4e-a26a-cc31aac98e67)

### Add Device
Wizard for adding new devices via Teach-In (automatic) or manual entry.

### Settings
Export/import full configuration as YAML, upload custom EEP.xml, local backups
(create/list/restore/delete — includes devices, mappings, custom profiles, and overrides),
view system information, restart services.

![Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/370072b1-7219-4566-a733-2c9e58b018fa)

## Configuration

### Serial Port

Select your EnOcean USB transceiver from the dropdown. Common ports:
- `/dev/ttyUSB0` (USB300)
- `/dev/ttyAMA0` (Raspberry Pi GPIO)

Leave empty when using TCP connection.

### TCP Port (Remote Connection)

Connect to a remote EnOcean transceiver over the network. Use this when your
EnOcean USB stick is connected to a USB-over-IP device (e.g., SMLIGHT SLZB-MR5U
USB-Passthrough, Silex DS-700, or any ser2net-based setup).

Format: `tcp:HOST:PORT` (e.g., `tcp:192.168.1.118:8638`)

When both serial and TCP are configured, **TCP takes priority**.

### MQTT Settings

The add-on automatically connects to Home Assistant's MQTT broker (Mosquitto) or you can select your own mqtt broker.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Host** | `core-mosquitto` | MQTT host, default `core-mosquitto` |
| **Port** | `1883` | Port, default `1883` |
| **User** | `homeassistant` | Leave blank if integreted Home Assistant |
| **Password** | `********` | Leave blank if integreted Home Assistant |
| **Discovery Prefix** | `homeassistant` | MQTT discovery prefix for HA auto-detection |
| **Topic Prefix** | `enoceanmqtt` | Topics are created as `enoceanmqtt/{device}/state` |
| **Client ID** | `enocean_gateway` | Unique MQTT client identifier |

### Cache Device States

When enabled (default), the add-on persists the last known state of all devices.
After a restart, these states are republished so that infrequent sensors (like a
Kessel Staufix that only reports every 8-10 hours) don't show as "unavailable".

## Migration from ChristopheHD Addon

If you are migrating from the ChristopheHD enocean-mqtt addon:

1. Export your config from the old addon (if possible)
2. Install this addon and stop the old one
3. Import your devices via the Settings page
4. The old `enoceanmqtt.devices` file format is supported for import
5. MQTT topics are compatible — existing HA entities should continue working

## Troubleshooting

### EnOcean Gateway Not Connecting
- Verify the correct serial port is selected in the addon settings
- Check that no other addon is using the same serial port
- Try unplugging and reconnecting the USB transceiver

### Devices Not Appearing in Home Assistant
- Check that MQTT is connected (green badge in the Web UI)
- Verify the MQTT discovery prefix matches your HA config (default: `homeassistant`)
- Check the addon log for errors

### Teach-In Not Working
- Make sure the EnOcean gateway shows "connected" (green status)
- Press the teach-in button firmly on your device
- Some devices require multiple presses or holding the button
