# Changelog
## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-21

### Bug fixes ###
For **D2-01-12 specifically**, the value_template uses IO to route values to the correct channel — to be confirmed once you have the channel 1 payload.

### Improvements ###
**Home Assistant Profiles:** The profile file `mapping_manager` has been expanded from 8 to 71 profiles. Here’s what was added:

- **Temperature** — Full A5-02 family (01→30), A5-04-02/03
- **Presence / Light** — A5-06-01, A5-07-02/03, A5-08-01/02/03
- **Air Quality** — A5-09-02 (CO₂ + temperature), A5-09-04 (CO₂ + temperature + humidity), A5-09-05 (VOC)
- **Meters** — A5-12-01 (electricity), A5-12-02 (gas), A5-12-03 (water)
- **HVAC** — A5-10-01/06 (thermostat)
- **Advanced Sensors** — A5-14-01/05/09/0A (vibration, window, illuminance)
- **Switches** (D2-01) — Full 01→0E, 0F (existing), 11 (2-channel dimmer), 12 (2-channel switch), with value_template filtering on IO to distinguish channels
- **Shutters** — D2-05-01
- **RPS** — F6-02-02, F6-03-01/02, F6-10-00 (window handle)

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-19

### Bug fixes

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-19

### Improvements
- **external MQTT** Bug fixes.
- **personal EEP Profile** Fix EEP settings profile.
- Fix translations.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-18

### Improvements
- **external MQTT** — now available, you can subscrive to an external MQTT with the associated credentials.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-04-17

### Improvements
- **Debounced State Persistence** — `last_states.yaml` is no longer written on every single `publish_state()` call. Updates mark the cache dirty and a single background task flushes the full YAML every 10s (and always on shutdown via a cancelled-task fallback). Eliminates SD/flash write amplification for installations with chatty sensors.
- **Startup Hardening** — If the EnOcean gateway is unreachable at addon start, the lifespan no longer crashes the whole app. Instead a background task retries `connect()` with backoff (5s → 60s) until the gateway comes up, so the Web UI stays available for reconfiguration and the supervisor doesn't restart in a loop.
- **Typed Transceiver Errors** — `_send_command()` now raises `NotConnectedError` / `CommandTimeoutError` / `TransportLostError` instead of returning `None` for every failure mode. `read_base_id()` catches each and logs a distinct reason — "Base ID read skipped" vs "timed out" vs "transport lost" — so log output tells you *why*, not just *that* it failed.

### Cleanup
- **Removed Dead `/api/gateway/send` Endpoint** — Had placeholder command bytes that didn't match real EEP encodings and wasn't called from anywhere in the frontend. The working command paths are `/api/gateway/test-actuator` and the MQTT command bridge.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes
- **False-Positive Teach-In for Non-Standard Devices** — A5 teach-in detection checks the LRN bit (bit 3 of data[3]). Some non-standard devices (e.g. Eltako Staufix boiler sensor) send regular data telegrams with LRN=0, which were mis-flagged as teach-ins on every received packet. Now only applies teach-in detection to senders that are NOT already configured — an already-known device cannot logically send a new teach-in.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes
- **Reconnect Base-ID Deadlock** — After a TCP reconnect, the base-ID re-read used to run synchronously inside `_read_loop` via `_wait_and_reconnect`. But `_send_command()` depends on `_read_loop` to deliver the response packet — so awaiting it from inside `_read_loop` deadlocked until the 3s command timeout ("Timeout waiting for response to command 0x08 / Invalid base ID response: None" in the logs). The base-ID refresh now runs as an independent task so the read loop resumes immediately and the response round-trip completes.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes
- **TCP Silent Disconnect Fix** — The read loop no longer silently loops when the TCP peer closes the connection. Previously, when an ESP32 gateway (or any TCP peer) sent a clean FIN, `recv()` returned empty bytes which the code treated as a read timeout — leaving the addon in a zombie state with no log output and no reconnect. `_serial_read()` now raises `ConnectionResetError` in that case so the read loop can trigger a reconnect.
- **TCP Keepalive** — Enabled `SO_KEEPALIVE` on TCP connections with `TCP_KEEPIDLE=30s`, `TCP_KEEPINTVL=10s`, `TCP_KEEPCNT=3`. Half-open connections (ESP32 crash, WiFi drop, router reboot — anything without a clean FIN) are now detected in ~60s instead of the OS default of ~2 hours.
- **Automatic Reconnect** — On transport loss (`ConnectionError`, `SerialException`, `OSError`), the read loop now closes the dead transport and retries the connect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → … → 30s max). Previously the task died and `/health` kept reporting `enocean_connected: true`.
- **Non-blocking Writes** — `send_telegram()` and `_send_command()` now write via `run_in_executor`. A full send buffer on a half-dead socket no longer freezes the entire FastAPI event loop (UI + MQTT).
- **Command Race Condition** — `_send_command()` is now serialized via an `asyncio.Lock` so concurrent callers cannot clobber each other's `_response_future` slot and mis-route responses.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-27

### New Features
- **TCP Port Configuration** — New `tcp_port` config option for connecting to remote EnOcean devices via TCP (e.g., `tcp:192.168.1.118:8638` for SLZB-MR5U USB-Passthrough or similar USB-over-IP devices). TCP takes priority over serial when both are configured.

### Bug Fixes
- **TCP Read Fix** — Fixed TCP socket read in serial handler. The `_serial_read()` method now correctly reads from TCP sockets (previously only serial devices were read, causing TCP connections to receive no data).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-10

- **Text Mode State Reset** — Proper cleanup of text/visual mode state when opening/closing editors

### Bug Fixes
- **HA Ingress Compatibility** — Fixed js-yaml library loading through HA Ingress proxy (dynamic path resolution instead of absolute `/static/` path)
- **Text Mode 400 Error** — Fixed form submission when clicking Text Mode button in Custom Profile modal (missing `type="button"`)
- **Backup Restore** — Custom profiles (custom_eep/) now properly reloaded after restore (EEP manager re-initialization)
- **Version Display** — Fixed version shown in UI sidebar (was stuck at 1.1.0)
- **jsyaml Error Handling** — Added availability checks and try-catch around YAML serialization calls

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

- **EEP.xml in Backups** — Custom EEP.xml is included in export/import ZIP backups
- **HA Entity Mapping Overrides** — Customize HA entity mappings per EEP profile directly from the profile detail view, with inline editor, auto-fill from EEP.xml fields, and save/reset functionality

### Improvements
- **Dark Mode Fixes** — Sidebar uses correct grey (#2b3035) instead of blue, removed `bg-light` from profile cards
- **Consistent dashes** — All feature descriptions use em-dash style

### Bug Fixes
- **Mapping Overrides in Backups** — `mapping_overrides.json` is now included in backup export/import
